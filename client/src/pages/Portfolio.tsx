                  Previously, I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at Fivetran, collaborating in a startup environment across multiple teams within the data pipeline platform and contributing to both source connectors and destination writers. My work spanned API-based connectors as well as database connectors such as DynamoDB and MongoDB, focusing on scalability, correctness, and performance. I led the design of a high-performance DynamoDB incremental sync engine, achieving 15× faster syncs, and implemented MongoDB Change Streams–based CDC incremental syncing, delivering a 5× performance improvement. On the destination side, I worked on data warehouse writers, including BigQuery and Snowflake. Beyond individual connectors, I authored and designed a reliability framework adopted across 10+ engineering teams, won multiple internal hackathons, mentored and onboarded interns through a structured training program, and regularly participated in technical interviews for engineering roles.

                I had the privilege of managing Sunil Kuruba at Fivetran, where he consistently demonstrated outstanding technical expertise and leadership. From day one, Sunil impressed with his deep product knowledge, quick coding ability, and willingness to mentor others. He rapidly became the go-to person for complex projects, playing a pivotal role in our team's success.
